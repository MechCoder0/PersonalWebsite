			<h1>The Introduction</h1>
			<p>
				Hello! I am here to explain some things that I havn't found well explained 
				in other parts of the interwebs. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Who am I? Well that is an interesting question. Who is anyone? 
				Are we merely a collection of dust particles floating in a never-ending
				blackness on a ball of dirt? Yes. But we are also created in the image of God, the 
				Imago Dei. But enough of that for now, I am a software developer
				who likes math and technology. This is to help you understand some of the things 
				I found myself explaining. I hope it is helpful!
