				<h1> Cell Phones!</h1>
				<div>
					<p>
						If you are looking to buy a phone, one of the first things 
						you need to know about cellphones is that there are two
						different cellular networks:
					</p>
					<h2>CDMA</h2>
					<p class="indent">
						The CDMA network is used by Sprint, Verizon, and U.S. Cellular.
					</p>
					<h2>GSM</h2>
					<p class="indent">
						The GSM network is used by AT&T, T-Mobile, and pretty much everyone else. As a note, 
						since Cricket Wireless is owned by AT&T it uses GSM.
					</p>
					<h2>Unlocked Phones</h2>
					<p class="indent">
						The second thing to know when purchasing a cellphone is what an 
						unlocked phone is.
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						Basically an unlocked phone is a phone that can be used for any
						carrier on one of the networks. A phone is usually only unlocked for
						GSM <b>OR</b> CDMA. Make sure to check which network it is unlocked for
						before purchasing a phone and finding out that your GSM unlocked phone 
						doesn't work with your current Sprint plan.
					</p>
					<h2>Operating Systems</h2>
					<p class="indent">
						Another thing to know about cellphones is what Operating System (OS) 
						you would like to use. The OS is how you interact with the phone. The
						OS will, to some extent, determain what apps you can download.
						There are three major operating systems for cell phones.
					</p>
					<div class="indent">
						<ul>
							<li>OSX (iPhones): Generally the most expensive. Very simple layout</li>
							<li>Android: Very modifiable, used on a lot of different cellphones</li>
							<li>Windows Phone: Only used on windows phones. Windows 8 was based off
								this OS</li>
						</ul>
